Bridge Firewall Configuration
#############################

********
Overview
********

In this section there's useful information on all firewall configuration that
can be done regarding bridges, and appropriate op-mode commands.
Configuration commands covered in this section:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge ...

From the main structure defined in :doc:`Firewall Overview</configuration/firewall/index>`
in this section you can find detailed information only for the next part
of the general structure:

.. code-block:: none

   - set firewall
       * bridge
            - forward
               + filter
            - input
               + filter
            - output
               + filter
            - prerouting
               + filter
            - name
               + custom_name

Traffic which is received by the router on an interface which is member of a
bridge is processed on the **Bridge Layer**. Before the bridge decision is
made, all packets are analyzed at **Prerouting**. First filters can be applied
here, and also rules for ignoring connection tracking system can be configured.
The relevant configuration that acts in **prerouting** is:

  * ``set firewall bridge prerouting filter ...``.

For traffic that needs to be switched internally by the bridge, base chain is
**forward**, and it's base command for filtering is ``set firewall bridge
forward filter ...``, which happens in stage 4, highlighted with red color.

.. figure:: /static/images/firewall-bridge-forward.png

For traffic destined to the router itself, or that needs to be routed (assuming
a layer3 bridge is configured), the base chain is **input**, the base command
is ``set firewall bridge input filter ...`` and the path is:

.. figure:: /static/images/firewall-bridge-input.png

If it's not dropped, then the packet is sent to **IP Layer**, and will be
processed by the **IP Layer** firewall: IPv4 or IPv6 ruleset. Check once again
the :doc:`general packet flow diagram</configuration/firewall/index>` if
needed.

And for traffic that originates from the bridge itself, the base chain is
**output**, base command is ``set firewall bridge output filter ...``, and
the path is:

.. figure:: /static/images/firewall-bridge-output.png

Custom bridge firewall chains can be created with the command ``set firewall bridge
name <name> ...``. In order to use such custom chain, a rule with action jump,
and the appropriate target should be defined in a base chain.

************
Bridge Rules
************

For firewall filtering, firewall rules need to be created. Each rule is
numbered, has an action to apply if the rule is matched, and the ability
to specify multiple matching criteria. Data packets go through the rules
from 1 - 999999, so order is crucial. At the first match the action of the
rule will be executed.

Actions
=======

If a rule is defined, then an action must be defined for it. This tells the
firewall what to do if all matching criterea in the rule are met.

In firewall bridge rules, the action can be:

   * ``accept``: accept the packet.

   * ``continue``: continue parsing next rule.

   * ``drop``: drop the packet.

   * ``jump``: jump to another custom chain.

   * ``return``: Return from the current chain and continue at the next rule
     of the last chain.

   * ``queue``: Enqueue packet to userspace.

   * ``notrack``: ignore connection tracking system. This action is only
     available in prerouting chain.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | return]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | return]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | return]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | notrack | queue | return]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | queue | return]

   This required setting defines the action of the current rule. If action is
   set to jump, then jump-target is also needed.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   jump-target <text>

   If action is set to ``queue``, use next command to specify the queue
   target. Range is also supported:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue <0-65535>

   Also, if action is set to ``queue``, use next command to specify the queue
   options. Possible options are ``bypass`` and ``fanout``:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue-options bypass

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   queue-options fanout

Also, **default-action** is an action that takes place whenever a packet does
not match any rule in its' chain. For base chains, possible options for
**default-action** are **accept** or **drop**.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter default-action
   [accept | drop]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> default-action
   [accept | continue | drop | jump | reject | return]

   This sets the default action of the rule-set if a packet does not match
   any of the rules in that chain. If default-action is set to ``jump``, then
   ``default-jump-target`` is also needed. Note that for base chains, default
   action can only be set to ``accept`` or ``drop``, while on custom chains
   more actions are available.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> default-jump-target <text>

   To be used only when ``default-action`` is set to ``jump``. Use this
   command to specify jump target for default rule.

.. note:: **Important note about default-actions:**
   If the default action for any base chain is not defined, then the default
   action is set to **accept** for that chain. For custom chains, if the 
   default action is not defined, then the default-action is set to **drop**.

Firewall Logs
=============

Logging can be enable for every single firewall rule. If enabled, other
log options can be defined.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> log

   Define the number of packets to queue inside the kernel before sending them
   to userspace. Only applicable if rule log is enabled and the log group is 
   defined.

Firewall Description
====================

For reference, a description can be defined for every defined custom chain.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> description <text>

   Provide a rule-set description to a custom firewall chain.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999>
   description <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999>
   description <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999>
   description <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999>
   description <text>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999>
   description <text>

   Provide a description for each rule.

Rule Status
===========

When defining a rule, it is enabled by default. In some cases, it is useful to
just disable the rule, rather than removing it.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999> disable
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> disable

   Command for disabling a rule but keep it in the configuration.

Matching criteria
=================

There are a lot of matching criteria against which the packet can be tested.
Please refer to :doc:`IPv4</configuration/firewall/ipv4>` and
:doc:`IPv6</configuration/firewall/ipv6>` matching criteria for more details.

Since bridges operats at layer 2, both matchers for IPv4 and IPv6 are
supported in bridge firewall configuration. Same applies to firewall groups.

Same specific matching criteria that can be used in bridge firewall are
described in this section:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> ethernet-type
   [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999> ethernet-type
   [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999> ethernet-type
   [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999> ethernet-type
   [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> ethernet-type
   [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]

   Match based on the Ethernet type of the packet.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> vlan
   ethernet-type [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999> vlan
   ethernet-type [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999> vlan
   ethernet-type [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999> vlan
   ethernet-type [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> vlan
   ethernet-type [802.1q | 802.1ad | arp | ipv4 | ipv6]

   Match based on the Ethernet type of the packet when it is VLAN tagged.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> vlan id
   <0-4096>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999> vlan id
   <0-4096>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999> vlan id
   <0-4096>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999> vlan id
   <0-4096>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> vlan id
   <0-4096>

   Match based on VLAN identifier. Range is also supported.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge forward filter rule <1-999999> vlan priority
   <0-7>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge input filter rule <1-999999> vlan priority
   <0-7>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge output filter rule <1-999999> vlan priority
   <0-7>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge prerouting filter rule <1-999999> vlan priority
   <0-7>
.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge name <name> rule <1-999999> vlan priority
   <0-7>

   Match based on VLAN priority (Priority Code Point - PCP). Range is also
   supported.

Packet Modifications
====================

Starting from **VyOS-1.5-rolling-202410060007**, the firewall can modify
packets before they are sent out. This feaure provides more flexibility in
packet handling.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge [prerouting | forward | output] filter
   rule <1-999999> set dscp <0-63>

   Set a specific value of Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP).

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge [prerouting | forward | output] filter
   rule <1-999999> set mark <1-2147483647>

   Set a specific packet mark value.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge [prerouting | forward | output] filter
   rule <1-999999> set tcp-mss <500-1460>

   Set the TCP-MSS (TCP maximum segment size) for the connection.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge [prerouting | forward | output] filter
   rule <1-999999> set ttl <0-255>

   Set the TTL (Time to Live) value.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge [prerouting | forward | output] filter
   rule <1-999999> set hop-limit <0-255>

   Set hop limit value.

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall bridge [forward | output] filter
   rule <1-999999> set connection-mark <0-2147483647>

   Set connection mark value.


Use IP firewall
===============

By default, for switched traffic, only the rules defined under ``set firewall
bridge`` are applied. There are two global-options that can be configured in
order to force deeper analysis of the packet on the IP layer. These options
are:

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall global-options apply-to-bridged-traffic ipv4

   This command enables the IPv4 firewall for bridged traffic. If this
   options is used, then packet will also be parsed by rules defined in ``set
   firewall ipv4 ...`` 

.. cfgcmd:: set firewall global-options apply-to-bridged-traffic ipv6

   This command enables the IPv6 firewall for bridged traffic. If this
   options is used, then packet will also be parsed by rules defined in ``set
   firewall ipv6 ...`` 

***********************
Operation-mode Firewall
***********************

Rule-set overview
=================

In this section you can find all useful firewall op-mode commands.

General commands for firewall configuration, counter and statistics:

.. opcmd:: show firewall
.. opcmd:: show firewall summary
.. opcmd:: show firewall statistics

And, to print only bridge firewall information:

.. opcmd:: show firewall bridge
.. opcmd:: show firewall bridge forward filter
.. opcmd:: show firewall bridge forward filter rule <rule>
.. opcmd:: show firewall bridge name <name>
.. opcmd:: show firewall bridge name <name> rule <rule>

Show Firewall log
=================

.. opcmd:: show log firewall
.. opcmd:: show log firewall bridge
.. opcmd:: show log firewall bridge forward
.. opcmd:: show log firewall bridge forward filter
.. opcmd:: show log firewall bridge name <name>
.. opcmd:: show log firewall bridge forward filter rule <rule>
