Static
######

Static routes are manually configured routes, which, in general, cannot be
updated dynamically from information VyOS learns about the network topology from
other routing protocols. However, if a link fails, the router will remove
routes, including static routes, from the :abbr:`RIPB (Routing Information
Base)` that used this interface to reach the next hop. In general, static
routes should only be used for very simple network topologies, or to override
the behavior of a dynamic routing protocol for a small number of routes. The
collection of all routes the router has learned from its configuration or from
its dynamic routing protocols is stored in the RIB. Unicast routes are directly
used to determine the forwarding table used for unicast packet forwarding.

*******************
IPv4 Unicast Routes
*******************

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> next-hop <address>

   Configure next-hop `<address>` for an IPv4 static route. Multiple static
   routes can be created.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> next-hop <address> disable

   Disable this IPv4 static route entry.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> next-hop <address>
   distance <distance>

   Defines next-hop distance for this route, routes with smaller administrative
   distance are elected prior to those with a higher distance.

   Range is 1 to 255, default is 1.

   .. note:: Routes with a distance of 255 are effectively disabled and not
      installed into the kernel.

IPv4 Interface Routes
=====================

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> interface
   <interface>

   Allows you to configure the next-hop interface for an interface-based IPv4
   static route. `<interface>` will be the next-hop interface where traffic is
   routed for the given `<subnet>`.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> interface
   <interface> disable

   Disables interface-based IPv4 static route.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> interface
   <interface> distance <distance>

   Defines next-hop distance for this route, routes with smaller administrative
   distance are elected prior to those with a higher distance.

   Range is 1 to 255, default is 1.

IPv4 BFD
========

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> next-hop <address> bfd

   Configure a static route for `<subnet>` using gateway `<address>` and use the
   gateway address as BFD peer destination address.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> next-hop <address> bfd profile <profile>

   Configure a static route for `<subnet>` using gateway `<address>` and use the
   gateway address as BFD peer destination address with BFD profile `<profile>`.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> next-hop <address> bfd multi-hop
   source-address <source-address>

   Configure a static route for `<subnet>` using gateway `<address>` and use the
   gateway address as BFD peer destination address with source address
   `<source>` but initiate a multi-hop session.

DHCP Interface Routes
=====================

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> dhcp-interface <interface>

   Defines route with DHCP interface supplying next-hop IP address.

IPv4 Reject Routes
==================

.. cfgcmd:: set protocol static route <subnet> reject

   Defines route which emits an ICMP unreachable when matched.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> reject distance <distance>

   Defines distance for this route, routes with smaller administrative
   distance are elected prior to those with a higher distance.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> reject tag <tag>

   Sets a tag for this route.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocol static route6 <subnet> reject

   Defines route which emits an ICMP unreachable when matched.

IPv4 Blackhole Routes
=====================

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> blackhole

   Use this command to configure a "black-hole" route on the router. A
   black-hole route is a route for which the system silently discard packets
   that are matched. This prevents networks leaking out public interfaces, but
   it does not prevent them from being used as a more specific route inside your
   network.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> blackhole distance <distance>

   Defines blackhole distance for this route, routes with smaller administrative
   distance are elected prior to those with a higher distance.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route <subnet> blackhole tag <tag>

   Sets a tag for this route.

*******************
IPv6 Unicast Routes
*******************

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route6 <subnet> next-hop <address>

   Configure next-hop `<address>` for an IPv6 static route. Multiple static
   routes can be created.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route6 <subnet> next-hop <address> disable

   Disable this IPv6 static route entry.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route6 <subnet> next-hop <address>
   distance <distance>

   Defines next-hop distance for this route, routes with smaller administrative
   distance are elected prior to those with a higher distance.

   Range is 1 to 255, default is 1.

   .. note:: Routes with a distance of 255 are effectively disabled and not
      installed into the kernel.

.. cfgcmd:: set protocols static route6 <subnet> next-hop <address> segments <segments>

   It is possible to specify a static route for ipv6 prefixes using an SRv6 segments
   instruction. The `/` separator can be used to specify multiple segment instructions.

   .. code-block:: none

     set protocols static route6 2001:db8:1000::/36 next-hop 2001:db8:201::ffff segments '2001:db8:aaaa::7/2002::4/2002::3/2002::2'
