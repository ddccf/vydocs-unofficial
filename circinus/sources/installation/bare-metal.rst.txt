PC Engines APU4
================

As this platform seems to be quite common in terms of noise, cost, power and
performance it makes sense to write a small installation manual.

This guide was developed using an APU4C4 board with the following specs:

* AMD Embedded G series GX-412TC, 1 GHz quad Jaguar core with 64 bit and AES-NI
  support, 32K data + 32K instruction cache per core, shared 2MB L2 cache.
* 4 GB DDR3-1333 DRAM, with optional ECC support
* About 6 to 10W of 12V DC power depending on CPU load
* 2 miniPCI express (one with SIM socket for 3G modem).
* 4 Gigabit Ethernet channels using Intel i211AT NICs

The board can be powered via 12V from the front or via a 5V onboard connector.

Depending on the VyOS versions you intend to install there is a difference in
the serial port settings (:vytask:`T1327`).

Create a bootable USB pendrive using e.g. Rufus_ on a Windows machine.

Connect serial port to a PC through null modem cable (RXD / TXD crossed over).
Set terminal emulator to 115200 8N1.

  Welcome to VyOS - vyos ttyS0

  vyos login:

You can now proceed with a regular image installation as described in
:ref:`installation`.

As the APU board itself still used a serial setting of 115200 8N1 it is
strongly recommended that you change the VyOS serial interface settings after
your first successful boot.

Use the following command to adjust the :ref:`serial-console` settings:

.. code-block:: none

  set system console device ttyS0 speed 115200

.. note:: Once you ``commit`` the above changes access to the serial interface
   is lost until you set your terminal emulator to 115200 8N1 again.

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos# show system console
   device ttyS0 {
     speed 115200
   }

VyOS 1.2 (rolling)
------------------

Installing the rolling release on an APU2 board does not require any change
on the serial console from your host side as :vytask:`T1327` was successfully
implemented.

Simply proceed with a regular image installation as described in
:ref:`installation`.

Qotom Q355G4
============

The install on this Q355G4 box is pretty much plug and play. The port numbering
the OS does might differ from the labels on the outside, but the UEFI firmware
has a port blink test built in with MAC addresses so you can very quickly
identify which is which. MAC labels are on the inside as well, and this test
can be done from VyOS or plain Linux too. Default settings in the UEFI will
make it boot, but depending on your installation wishes (i.e. storage type,
boot type, console type) you might want to adjust them. This Qotom company
seems to be the real OEM/ODM for many other relabelling companies like
Protectli.

Hardware
--------

There are a number of other options, but they all seem to be close to Intel
reference designs, with added features like more serial ports, more network
interfaces and the likes. Because they don't deviate too much from standard
designs all the hardware is well-supported by mainline. It accepts one LPDDR3
SO-DIMM, but chances are that if you need more than that, you'll also want
something even beefier than an i5. There are options for antenna holes, and SIM
slots, so you could in theory add an LTE/Cell modem (not tested so far).

The chassis is a U-shaped alu extrusion with removable I/O plates and removable
bottom plate. Cooling is completely passive with a heatsink on the SoC with
internal and external fins, a flat interface surface, thermal pad on top of
that, which then directly attaches to the chassis, which has fins as well. It
comes with mounting hardware and rubber feet, so you could place it like a
desktop model or mount it on a VESA mount, or even wall mount it with the
provided mounting plate. The closing plate doubles as internal 2.5" mounting
place for an HDD or SSD, and comes supplied with a small SATA cable and SATA
power cable.

Power supply is a 12VDC barrel jack, and included switching power supply, which
is why SATA power regulation is on-board. Internally it has a NUC-board-style
on-board 12V input header as well, the molex locking style.

There are WDT options and auto-boot on power enable, which is great for remote
setups. Firmware is reasonably secure (no backdoors found, BootGuard is enabled
in enforcement mode, which is good but also means no coreboot option), yet has
most options available to configure (so it's not locked out like most firmwares
are).

An external RS232 serial port is available, internally a GPIO header as well.
It does have Realtek based audio on board for some reason, but you can disable
that. Booting works on both USB2 and USB3 ports. Switching between serial BIOS
mode and HDMI BIOS mode depends on what is connected at startup; it goes into
serial mode if you disconnect HDMI and plug in serial, in all other cases it's
HDMI mode.

Partaker i5
===========

.. figure:: ../static/images/600px-Partaker-i5.jpg

I believe this is actually the same hardware as the Protectli. I purchased it
in June 2018. It came pre-loaded with pfSense.

`Manufacturer product page <http://www.inctel.com.cn/product/detail/338.html>`_.

Installation
------------

* Write VyOS ISO to USB drive of some sort
* Plug in VGA, power, USB keyboard, and USB drive
* Press "SW" button on the front (this is the power button; I don't know what
  "SW" is supposed to mean).
* Begin rapidly pressing delete on the keyboard. The boot prompt is very quick,
  but with a few tries you should be able to get into the BIOS.
* Chipset > South Bridge > USB Configuration: set XHCI to Disabled and USB 2.0
  (EHCI) to Enabled. Without doing this, the USB drive won't boot.
* Boot to the VyOS installer and install as usual.

Warning the interface labels on my device are backwards; the left-most "LAN4"
port is eth0 and the right-most "LAN1" port is eth3.

Acrosser AND-J190N1
===================

.. figure:: ../static/images/480px-Acrosser_ANDJ190N1_Front.jpg

.. figure:: ../static/images/480px-Acrosser_ANDJ190N1_Back.jpg

This microbox network appliance was build to create OpenVPN bridges. It can
saturate a 100Mbps link. It is a small (serial console only) PC with 6 Gb LAN

You may have to add your own RAM and HDD/SSD. There is no VGA connector. But
Acrosser provides a DB25 adapter for the VGA header on the motherboard (not
used).

BIOS Settings:
--------------

First thing you want to do is getting a more user friendly console to configure
BIOS. Default VT100 brings a lot of issues. Configure VT100+ instead.

For practical issues change speed from 115200 to 9600. 9600 is the default
speed at which both linux kernel and VyOS will reconfigure the serial port
when loading.

Connect to serial (115200bps). Power on the appliance and press Del in the
console when requested to enter BIOS settings.

Advanced > Serial Port Console Redirection > Console Redirection Settings:

* Terminal Type : VT100+
* Bits per second : 9600

Save, reboot and change serial speed to 9600 on your client.

Some options have to be changed for VyOS to boot correctly. With XHCI enabled
the installer can’t access the USB key. Enable EHCI instead.

Reboot into BIOS, Chipset > South Bridge > USB Configuration:

* Disable XHCI
* Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) Support

Install VyOS:
-------------

Create a VyOS bootable USB key. I used the 64-bit ISO (VyOS 1.1.7) and
`LinuxLive USB Creator <http://www.linuxliveusb.com/>`_.

I'm not sure if it helps the process but I changed default option to live-serial
(line “default xxxx”) on the USB key under syslinux/syslinux.cfg.

I connected the key to one black USB port on the back and powered on. The first
VyOS screen has some readability issues. Press :kbd:`Enter` to continue.

Then VyOS should boot and you can perform the ``install image``

.. _gowin_gw-fn-1ur1-10g:

Gowin GW-FN-1UR1-10G
====================

A platform utilizing an Intel Alder Lake-N100 CPU with 6M cache, TDP 6W.
Onboard LPDDR5 16GB RAM and 128GB eMMC (can be used for image installation).

The appliance comes with 2 * 2.5GbE Intel I226-V and 3 * 1GbE Intel I210
where one supports IEEE802.3at PoE+ (Typical 30W).

In addition there is a Mellanox ConnectX-3 2* 10GbE SFP+ NIC available.

**NOTE:** This is the entry level platform. Other derivates exists with
i3-N305 CPU and 2x 25GbE!

Cooling
-------

The device itself is passivly cooled, whereas the power supply has an active fan.
Even if the main processor is powered off, the power supply fan is operating and
the entire chassis draws 7.5W. During operation the chassis drew arround 38W.

BIOS Settings
-------------

No settings needed to be altered, everything worked out of the box!

Installation
------------

The system provides a regular RS232 console port using 115200,8n1 setting which
is sufficient to install VyOS from a USB pendrive.

First Boot
----------

Please note that there is a weirdness on the network interface mapping.
The interface <-> MAC mapping is going upwards but the NICs are placed
somehow swapped on the mainboard/MACs programmed in a swapped order.

See interface description for more detailed mapping.
